Then, all of a sudden, the lights went out. “Don’t worry, Freddy, I have everything under control,” said Brian. He found a few candles and a couple of flashlights. He gave one flashlight to Freddy. Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It sounded like someone crashed into something. “What was that?” cried Freddy. “I’m scared.” “I don’t know,” said Brian. “Would you please bring me the phone? I think I should call the police.” Freddy gave Brian the phone. Brian picked up the phone and then thought for a moment. He might call and then find out nothing was wrong. He decided to call only if there was an emergency. He remembered when a firefighter came to their school. He talked to the class about safety and how to stay safe. He also told them what to do during an emergency. He told them they should stay calm and not panic. “Don’t worry, Freddy, I’m sure there is nothing to worry about,” said Brian. Freddy still looked scared. “Shall we go look outside and check? I’m sure it’s nothing,” said Brian, trying to comfort Freddy.",

Could someone or something have knocked it over? Suddenly, something brown walked by. “Ah!” they both screamed. “Oh, look, it’s Pumpkin,” said Freddy. “Pumpkin must have knocked the flowerpot over,” said Brian.",

Let’s go and take Pumpkin to her,” said Brian. “Could you please go alone?” said Freddy. “I would rather go to sleep now.” “Okay, I’ll go alone,” said Brian. Brian took the cat, Pumpkin, and went to Mrs. Tupper’s house. He found her back door open. “Mrs. Tupper,” called Brian from behind the open door. There was no answer. He walked inside. It was very dark. “Mrs. Tupper,” he said while flashing his light on the couch.",

There she was, Mrs. Tupper, sleeping in the chair. “Goodness,” she said, “I must have fallen asleep.” Brian gave the cat to Mrs. Tupper. “Thank you, Brian,” said Mrs. Tupper. “My son must have forgotten to close the door when he left to go out with his friends. That must be how Pumpkin got out of the house.” “Good night, Mrs. Tupper.” Brian went back home. He was relieved that nothing was wrong. As he opened his front door, the lights came back on. Finally. That was a night he wouldn’t forget.",
